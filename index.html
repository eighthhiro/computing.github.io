            <h3>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</h3>
            <h5>Inventor of Binary</h5>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (born on July 1, 1646) was widely known for discovering the use of the binary system, which is now the base of all computing systems and operations. Also, Similar to the abacus, he invented the step reckoner, which was used as a calculator design for nearly three centuries.</p>

            <h5>Father of the Computer</h5>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Charles Babbage (born December 26, 1791) was a mathematician and inventor who was credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. He developed projects such as the Difference and the Analytical Engine, which inspired the first generation of computer scientists who based their works on his inventions.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Ada Lovelace (born December 10, 1815) discovered that a computer could follow a sequence of instructions to make complex calculations, which she then called a program. She wrote hypothetical programs for Babbage's Analytical Engine and, thus, considered the world's first programmer.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Alan Turing (born June 23, 1912) is the father of computer science and the founding father of artificial intelligence. He theorized that the brain is an unorganized machine, that through training can become a universal machine. Also, he invented the Turing Machine, an abstract computational model that tests the limits of computation.</p>

                <p>Herman Hollerith (born November 17, 1929) was the founder of IBM and started as a Computing, Tabulating & Recording Company. He invented the Tabulating Machine that helped the US Bureau of Census compile data on population faster. From just an electro-mechanical idea that turned into a leading hardware producer in 1960.</p>
